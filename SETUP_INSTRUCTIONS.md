## Testing the System

1. **Student Flow:**
   - Register a new student account
   - Login and access dashboard
   - Enroll in a course (payment integration)
   - Access course videos

2. **Admin Flow:**
   - Login as admin
   - Create new courses
   - Add videos to courses
   - View student enrollments and analytics

## Migration Notes

- Existing payment data is preserved in the legacy User model
- New payments will create both User and Student records
- Course pages maintain backward compatibility
- All existing functionality continues to work

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check MONGO_URI in .env file

2. **Authentication Issues:**
   - Verify JWT_SECRET is set
   - Check token expiration (7 days default)

3. **File Upload Issues:**
   - Ensure uploads directory exists
   - Check file permissions

4. **Payment Issues:**
   - Verify Razorpay credentials
   - Check payment verification logic

## Next Steps

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Install dependencies
3. Create admin account
4. Test student registration and course enrollment
5. Add your first course and videos through admin panel

The system is now ready for production use with proper authentication, course management, and video delivery!
